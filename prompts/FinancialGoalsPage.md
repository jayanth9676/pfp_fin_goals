# Financial Goals Page Implementation

1. Create a new React component file `FinancialGoalsPage.js` in the `src/pages` directory.

2. Implement the following features in the `FinancialGoalsPage` component:
   - Display suggested financial goals based on the user's age (fetch from Lambda function)
   - Allow users to set a goal amount and adjust it
   - Recommend a time period for achieving the goal (allow users to modify)
   - Suggest investment/savings options based on the goal term length (use Bedrock or SageMaker for AI-powered suggestions)
   - Show a calculator (e.g., for mutual funds)
   - Suggest credit cards that align with the user's financial goals (fetch from DynamoDB)

3. Create subcomponents as needed:
   - `GoalSuggestion`: Display and select financial goals
   - `GoalCustomization`: Allow users to adjust goal amount and time period
   - `InvestmentOptions`: Show recommended investment/savings options
   - `Calculator`: Implement a financial calculator (e.g., mutual funds)
   - `CreditCardSuggestions`: Display credit card recommendations

4. Implement state management for user inputs and selections using React hooks.

5. Add appropriate styling using Material-UI components to match the existing design.

6. Implement API calls to Lambda functions for fetching and saving user data:
   - Use AWS Amplify's API module to make calls to API Gateway
   - Ensure proper error handling and loading states

7. Integrate with AWS services:
   - Use S3 to store and retrieve user's financial goal progress
   - Implement CloudWatch logs for monitoring and debugging
   - Use DynamoDB to store user's financial goals and progress

8. Implement gamification elements:
   - Create a ProgressTracker component to visualize user progress towards financial goals
   - Use Lambda functions to calculate and update user's achievements and rewards

9. Add AI-powered features:
   - Use Bedrock or SageMaker to generate personalized financial advice and goal suggestions
   - Implement AI-generated quests and challenges

10. Ensure proper authentication and authorization using AWS Cognito.
