# Implement Additional Features

1. Create a new component `SpendingHabitsAnalysis.js` in the `src/components` directory:
   - Implement a graph to display user spending habits (use a charting library like Chart.js)
   - Analyze spending peaks and suggest areas for reduction (use Lambda function with Bedrock/SageMaker)
   - Provide savings recommendations based on spending habits

2. Integrate the SpendingHabitsAnalysis component into the FinancialGoalsPage.

3. Enhance gamification elements:
   - Create a ProgressTracker component to visualize user progress towards financial goals
   - Implement a rewards system for achieving milestones (store in DynamoDB)
   - Add challenges and quests related to saving and investing (generate using Bedrock/SageMaker)

4. Enhance AI assistant capabilities:
   - Integrate AI-generated financial quests and personalized challenges using Bedrock/SageMaker
   - Implement a virtual economy system with in-game currency (store in DynamoDB)

5. Add community features:
   - Implement community challenges and goals (store in DynamoDB)
   - Create investment tournaments functionality (use Lambda for calculations)

6. Develop educational content:
   - Create interactive financial literacy modules (store content in S3)
   - Integrate educational achievements into the gamification system (track in DynamoDB)

7. Implement real-world rewards integration:
   - Partner with brands to offer tangible rewards for achieving financial milestones
   - Create a redemption system for users to claim their rewards (use Lambda and DynamoDB)

8. Ensure all new features are properly integrated with existing AWS services:
   - Use API Gateway for RESTful endpoints
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization with Cognito
   - Store user data and progress in DynamoDB
   - Use S3 for storing static assets and content
   - Leverage CloudWatch for monitoring and logging
   - Use Bedrock/SageMaker for AI-powered features and recommendations

Note: Some of these features may require backend support and third-party integrations. Implement mock data and placeholder functionality where necessary, and plan for future integration with actual data sources and APIs.
