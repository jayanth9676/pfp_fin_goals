# Implement Lambda Functions for Financial Goals

1. Create a new Lambda function `getFinancialGoalSuggestions`:
   - Input: User age and financial profile
   - Output: Suggested financial goals
   - Integrate with Bedrock or SageMaker for AI-powered suggestions

2. Create a Lambda function `saveFinancialGoal`:
   - Input: User ID, goal details (type, amount, timeframe)
   - Output: Confirmation of saved goal
   - Store data in DynamoDB

3. Create a Lambda function `getInvestmentOptions`:
   - Input: Goal type, amount, and timeframe
   - Output: Suggested investment options
   - Use Bedrock or SageMaker for personalized recommendations

4. Create a Lambda function `getCreditCardSuggestions`:
   - Input: User's financial goals and profile
   - Output: Recommended credit cards
   - Fetch data from DynamoDB

5. Create a Lambda function `updateGoalProgress`:
   - Input: User ID, goal ID, progress update
   - Output: Updated goal progress
   - Update data in DynamoDB and trigger notifications if milestones are reached

6. Implement proper error handling and logging using CloudWatch.

7. Set up appropriate IAM roles and permissions for each Lambda function.

8. Configure API Gateway to expose these Lambda functions as RESTful endpoints.

9. Update the Amplify configuration to include the new API endpoints.
